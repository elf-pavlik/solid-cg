# Solid Community Group

This repository contains the source code of the [W3C Solid Community
Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/solid/) (CG) processes. The work is part
of the [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org/).

The CG has a [Charter](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/charter/).

The [Solid Technical Reports](https://solidproject.org/TR/) (TR) include
specifications, use cases and requirements, best practices and guidelines,
primers and notes about the Solid ecosystem. The CG's Work Items are linked
from the TR homepage, and the source code is available from the
[solid/specification](https://github.com/solid/specification) repository.

## Participation

All substantive contributors to [Work
Items](https://solidproject.org/TR/#work-items) must be members of the Solid
CG. It’s easy to [join the CG](https://www.w3.org/community/solid/join) if
you’d like to contribute. Guests are welcome but do not have voting rights.

Anyone can join the [Solid specification
chat](https://matrix.to/#/#solid_specification:gitter.im).
